- `terraform.tfvars.example` - Configuration examples
- `backend.tf` - State management setup

**Key talking points:**
- "Infrastructure as Code ensures consistency and version control"
- "Modular design allows reusability across environments"
- "Terraform state stored securely in S3 with DynamoDB locking"

### **3. Live Infrastructure Status (3 minutes)**

**Check current infrastructure status:**

```powershell
# Show AWS resources
aws eks describe-cluster --name my-eks-cluster --region ap-south-1
```

```powershell
# Show EKS nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

```powershell
# Show running applications
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

**Key talking points:**
- "Cluster is live and running in AWS"
- "Multiple worker nodes for redundancy"
- "Applications deployed and healthy"

### **4. Customer Access Demo (3 minutes)**

**Demonstrate customer access:**

```powershell
# Get the customer-facing URL
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --region ap-south-1 --query "LoadBalancers[?contains(LoadBalancerName, 'web-alb')].DNSName" --output text
```

**Open the customer URL in browser:**
- Show the web application interface
- Explain this is what customers see
- Highlight that backend app servers are completely hidden

**Key talking points:**
- "This is the customer-facing endpoint"
- "Load balancer distributes traffic across multiple servers"
- "Backend application servers are secure in private network"

### **5. CI/CD Pipeline Demo (5 minutes)**

**Show Jenkins CI/CD:**

```powershell
# Get Jenkins URL
aws ec2 describe-instances --region ap-south-1 --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=*jenkins*" --query "Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress" --output text
```

**Open Jenkins dashboard:**
- Navigate to `http://[JENKINS-IP]:8080`
- Show the configured pipeline
- Demonstrate a deployment

**Trigger a deployment:**
1. Go to Jenkins job
2. Click "Build Now"
3. Show the pipeline stages
4. Show deployment to EKS cluster

**Key talking points:**
- "Automated deployments reduce human error"
- "Complete audit trail of all deployments"
- "Can integrate with any Git repository"
- "Supports blue/green deployments and rollbacks"

### **6. Monitoring & Management (2 minutes)**

**Show operational capabilities:**

```powershell
# Show application logs
kubectl logs -l app=sample-web-app -n sample-apps --tail=10
```

```powershell
# Show resource usage
kubectl top nodes
```

```powershell
# Show service health
kubectl get services --all-namespaces
```

**Key talking points:**
- "Real-time monitoring and logging"
- "Resource utilization tracking"
- "Health checks and automated recovery"

## 📊 **Demo Preparation Checklist**

### **Before the Demo:**

```powershell
# 1. Verify infrastructure is running
.\scripts\test-all-endpoints.ps1

# 2. Check EKS cluster health
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

# 3. Verify Jenkins is accessible
# Check Jenkins URL in browser

# 4. Test customer endpoint
# Open ALB URL in browser

# 5. Prepare architecture diagram
start EKS_Architecture_Diagram.png
```

### **Demo Environment Check:**

```powershell
# Run this 30 minutes before demo
Write-Host "🔍 Pre-Demo Health Check" -ForegroundColor Green

# Check AWS CLI
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Check kubectl
kubectl version --client

# Check cluster connectivity
kubectl cluster-info

# Check all endpoints
.\scripts\test-all-endpoints.ps1
```

## 🎯 **Q&A Preparation**

### **Common Manager Questions:**

**Q: "How much does this cost?"**
A: "Current infrastructure costs approximately $X/month. Scales automatically with usage. ROI through faster deployments and reduced downtime."

**Q: "How secure is this?"**
A: "Enterprise AWS security, private networks, encrypted traffic, IAM roles, security groups. Follows AWS Well-Architected Framework."

**Q: "Can this handle production traffic?"**
A: "Yes, designed for production. Load balancer handles high traffic, auto-scaling for demand spikes, multi-AZ for 99.9% availability."

**Q: "How do we deploy new features?"**
A: "Developers push code to Git → Jenkins automatically tests → Deploys to staging → Promotes to production. Zero-downtime deployments."

**Q: "What if something breaks?"**
A: "Automated monitoring, health checks, instant rollback capability. Infrastructure as Code ensures consistent environments."

**Q: "Can we expand this?"**
A: "Absolutely. Modular design allows easy addition of new services, environments, or regions. Built for growth."
